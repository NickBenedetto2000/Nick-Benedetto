Hi there! My name is Nick Benedetto. I am interested in learning some new programing languages (R and Python). I feel as if obtaining these skills will further me in my near future within any profession I choose to be a part of. Many of my hobbies right now involve me working on my physical health by going to the gym and staying in shape, not only does this physically help me but it is also a nice little scape goat from the real-world, in other words it is mentally therapeutic. Aside from my main hobby getting my master's is my main focus right now and I am very excited for this new journey.
